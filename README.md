# WOLFforce Installer

As its name suggestsn this tool let you download and install almost anything around the WOLFforce modpacks, like launchers modpacks, updates, etc.
It was originally designed to provide an easy way to install Java and MultiMC, and was developped with the idea to use it for almost any update or installation you need to play WOLFforce modpacks, so it's meant to be modular.
The app is part of the Hera project to simplify players life with installing and updating modpacks. It was written in C# using WPF (It's my 1st C# app so code may be a little weird sometimes).

This project was archived to achieve somthing larger, that merges all this features plus many more into one unified application with enhanced protability, known as WOLFforce Revolt.
